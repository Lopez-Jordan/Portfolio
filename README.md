## Description
This is a portfolio website made with react! You can see my skills, my github, linkedIn and email me!
<br>
For this site, I used `React Browser Router` to control the url endpoints and React Hooks like `useState` for added functionality.

## Installation
To install on your own machine, simply clone down my repo, run `npm install` at the root directory, then run `npm run dev` in order to start the client server!
